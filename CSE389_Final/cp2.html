      Two "Game of Thrones" actresses, an Oscar-winner, a former Miss America, several music legends, and more big names came to Syracuse. Some were performing at concerts or filming new movies in Central New York, while others just stopped by to say hi.

Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas
"Game of Thrones" and "X-Men: Apocalypse" actress Sophie Turner was spotted at the New York State Fair on a date with Joe Jonas, who performed at Chevy Court with his "Cake by the Ocean" band DNCE. Weeks later, the couple announced they're engaged.
